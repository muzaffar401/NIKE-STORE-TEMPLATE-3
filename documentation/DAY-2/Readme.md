## Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation

### System Architecture

Hereâ€™s the high-level system architecture diagram illustrating how the components interact:
1. **Frontend (Next.js):** The user interface for browsing products.
2. **Sanity CMS:** Acts as the backend, managing data like product listings and user information.
3. **Product Data API:** Fetches product information from Sanity CMS for dynamic display on the frontend.
4. **Third-Party API:** Handles integrations like shipment tracking and payment processing.
5. **Shipment Tracking API:** Fetches real-time order delivery status.
6. **Payment Gateway:** Processes payments securely and sends payment confirmations back to Sanity CMS.

### Key Workflow Steps

1. **Product Browsing:** The frontend requests product listings via the Product Data API connected to Sanity CMS.
2. **Order Placement:** The user places an order; details are sent to Sanity CMS via an API request.
3. **Shipment Tracking:** Order shipment data is fetched through the Third-Party API and displayed on the frontend.

### Technologies

**Frontend:**
- Next.js: For building server-rendered, dynamic UIs.
- Tailwind CSS: For responsive and beautiful designs.
- Shadcn/UI: For customizable UI components.

**Backend:**
- Sanity CMS: To manage and structure content effectively.
- Clerk: For user authentication and management.

**APIs:**
- ShipEngine API: For shipment tracking and delivery management.
- Stripe API: For secure and seamless payment processing.

**Tools:**
- GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
- Postman: To test and document APIs.
- Vercel: For fast and reliable deployment.

### Sanity and Next.js Interaction

Sanity CMS is integrated into the Next.js application to provide dynamic and flexible content management. The interaction works as follows:

1. **Data Management in Sanity:** All the e-commerce data (e.g., products, orders, customers) is stored and managed in Sanity's content studio.
2. **Fetching Data:** Next.js fetches data from Sanity using GROQ queries via Sanity's API endpoints. These queries retrieve structured content, ensuring high flexibility.
3. **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** For dynamic pages like product detail pages, order details page.
4. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pages like home and category pages are pre-rendered at build time.
5. **Real-time Updates:** Sanity's webhooks notify the application of changes, enabling immediate updates without manual rebuilds.
6. **Rendering Components:** The fetched data is passed to React components for rendering dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

This seamless integration ensures a robust and scalable e-commerce platform.
